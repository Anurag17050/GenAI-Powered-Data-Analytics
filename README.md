Tata Group Data Analytics Job Simulation ‚Äì Forage (June 2025)
====================================================================

Overview:
---------
This repository contains my completed work for the Tata Group Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program offered through Forage in June 2025. The simulation aimed to provide hands-on experience with data analysis, AI strategy, and ethical implementation within a financial services context, specifically for Tata iQ and its client, Geldium.

Program Objective:
------------------
To simulate the role of a data analytics associate working on an AI-powered credit risk and collections strategy for Geldium. The focus was on analyzing data quality, proposing a predictive modeling framework, communicating business recommendations, and designing an autonomous and ethical AI system.

Completed Tasks:
----------------
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted in-depth data quality assessment using GenAI tools.
   - Identified key issues such as missing data, inconsistencies, and early indicators of customer delinquency.
   - Proposed appropriate data handling strategies (e.g., imputation, removal, synthetic data generation).
   - [Task-1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M4KNxF7ChnU3tk8kpUIVhi55uWx2EUuy/view?usp=sharing)

2. **Predictive Modeling Strategy:**
   - Outlined a no-code predictive modeling framework using logistic regression.
   - Selected top 5 input features (e.g., credit utilization, income, past delinquencies).
   - Justified model choice with considerations of interpretability and compliance.
   - Developed an evaluation plan including accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and fairness checks.
   - [Task-2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OWVSABssIMji5TI155FouxF8FkyP9PNy/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109346915235299844519&rtpof=true&sd=true)

3. **Stakeholder Report:**
   - Communicated insights to Geldium‚Äôs Head of Collections.
   - Highlighted top 3 risk indicators and segmented high-risk customers.
   - Delivered SMART business recommendations with supporting rationale.
   - Addressed ethical concerns including fairness, bias mitigation, and explainability.
   - [Task-3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JByxNG5lMfJKEkUJqiydTsSvj2E6USPN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109346915235299844519&rtpof=true&sd=true)

4. **AI Collections System Concept:**
   - Designed a high-level autonomous AI-powered collections system.
   - Illustrated how the system processes data, makes decisions, and learns over time.
   - Defined agentic AI roles and responsible AI guardrails (fairness, explainability, compliance).
   - Outlined expected business impact including reduced delinquency, cost savings, and improved customer experience.
   - [Task-4](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MmtCS1bbhF3DJFQGLP6GHEkU0otjYyGi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109346915235299844519&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Tools Used:
-----------
- Forage Simulation Platform
- GenAI (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek)
- Microsoft Word & PowerPoint
- Prompt engineering techniques for structured EDA and modeling

Learning Outcomes:
------------------
‚úî Strengthened practical understanding of real-world data analysis workflows.  
‚úî Applied ethical AI frameworks in decision-making and system design.  
‚úî Developed communication skills for stakeholder reporting and executive-level presentations.  
‚úî Gained exposure to predictive modeling concepts and evaluation techniques in financial services.
